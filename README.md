# ReturnGenius: End-to-End Product Return Prediction ML Pipeline

Robust, production-ready machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of product returns, featuring ETL, advanced EDA, feature engineering, model training, explainability, and automated CI/CD deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular ETL Pipeline**: Clean and prepare raw data for ML workflows.
- **Advanced EDA**: Uncover patterns in returns with statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Automate encoding, creation of meaningful features, and transformation.
- **Model Training & Tracking**: Train powerful models (Random Forest), track with MLflow.
- **Explainability**: Integrate SHAP for transparent, actionable feature importance.
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions for seamless retraining and validation on every push.
